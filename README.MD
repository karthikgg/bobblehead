<<Bobblehead>> - Student Project Idea Sharing Hub

This is a platform for posting and browsing project ideas (outside regular coursework for online education like Udacity, Coursera, etc.). The idea originated fromt the fact that after completing the Udacity nanodegree program, where do students go to advance their skills? Bobblehead portal will allow students to connect and share ideas, and maybe even collaborate on projects.

Key Features:

- Project will have the following fields: "name", "instructions"/"description", "tags", "articles"/"helpful links", "complexity", "project type", "recommended people on project"
- You can see who created the project
- You can see who are currently working on the project, and who has finished the project.

- Users will be able to log in by creating their accounts or through Google, or Facebook, etc.
- Users will be able to create projects 
- Users will be able to delete the projects they have created, if no one is working on them
- Users will be able to edit projects, if they have created them

- Users will be identified by an email address, along with name, last name
- User will have a profile, which will indicate the nanodegree the user is on 
- User profile will show how many projects they have added
- User profile will show how many projects they have worked on, along with link to repo (if provided)
- User profile will show how many people like/dislike their solution
